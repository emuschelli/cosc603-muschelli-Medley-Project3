Bug Fix.txt file


VendingMachineItem.java

There were two potential bugs for this file.  
This resulted in the price and name variable not being instantiated as having default values.  
The code change to correct this potential bug would be to instantiate both price and name with 
the following values within the VendingMachineItem.java file:
-	Price = 0.00;
-	Name = “Candy”;

VendingMachine.java

There were three potential bugs for this file.
This resulted in the "INVALID_AMOUNT_MESSAGE" error message being corrected to state > 0 and not >=0 being 
presented to the customer; "balance" variable was not instantiated as having default value which we sent
to  0.00 preventing potential issues with the balance; and "INITIAL_BALANCE" default value being changed from 0 to 0.00 
preventing potential issues with the "int" value not casting correctly to a double.

It is always good practice to ensure that your variables are declared and instantiated with a default to prevent any 
possible issues with variable values when being used/passed into methods.
