Bug Fix.txt file

There were two potential bugs for this file.  
This resulted in the price and name variable not being instantiated as having default values.  
The code change to correct this potential bug would be to instantiate both price and name with 
the following values within the VendingMachineItem.java file:
-	Price = 0.00;
-	Name = “Candy”;
